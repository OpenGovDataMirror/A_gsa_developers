This repository is from a set of earlier efforts to organize the GSA's API efforts.  The [proposed microsite](https://gsa.github.io/developers/) has now been overtaken by [open.gsa.gov](http://open.gsa.gov).  

Some of the below can be picked back up and moved forward with at any time, if there's interest.  

======================


~~This project serves to organize several efforts, including those listed below.  Please help by contributing [ideas and feedback](https://github.com/GSA/developers/issues) for any of these projects and by [suggesting new ideas](https://github.com/GSA/developers/issues/new).~~

~~Everyone is invited to participate, whether you work at GSA or not.  All are welcome!~~
